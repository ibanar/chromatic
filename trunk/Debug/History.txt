Version 1.21

        [NEW]   - Added support for GLSL and DXSL files.

                - Languages scripts are now extracted from the languages files
                  and located in a separate directory (Languages/Scripts).
                  So it should be much easier to edit them now.
                  Also created LANGSCRIPTSDIR directory.

                - Added an option disable the include function of dropped files
                  (When enabled, dropping files in sources windows will create a new window

                  (mainly to avoid troubles with .lib, .a, .obj and .o files).

                - Project and workspaces files are now recognized during drag'n'drop operations
                  from shell, the user can also drag'n'drop directory names
                  (in that case Chrome will display a standard files selector).

                - Added the ability to replace missing files in projects
                  (a window with these files is displayed, if necessary
                   right after loading a project).

                - Added OpenGL projects for Asm and C/C++.

                - "Close All" command will display the list of modified files
                  (instead of asking to save them one by one).

                - The IDE now save/restore the position of it's main window
                  (mainly to avoid some annoying troubles with multi-monitors configs).

                  opened files anymore.

                - Fixed several visuals glitches occuring under windows XP.

                - Some popup menus weren't displayed at correct location
                  under certain circumstances.

                - Custom libraries weren't written into project files during projects creation
                  if files gathering wasn't selected, fixed.

                  right after it's creation (was left empty previously).

                - Better handling of unsaved projects (also they are now included in
                  auto-save notifications and in files change detections).

                - Projects main icons are only saved when required.

        [NEW]   - Gathering of files referenced with IMPORTINCLUDE or IMPORTLIB
                  in project creations is now optional. If disabled, Chrome will
                  just use the given location of the file without further processing
                  (If no directory is given, [TEMPLATEDIR] is assumed).

                - Ctrl+Space (Insert snippet) changed to Ctrl+Alt+Space
                  Ctrl+Space is now dedicated to words completion engine

                  (saved in external *.MBK files).

                  Note: - File will be removed/not created if no bookmarks are present.
                        - Bookmarks of included/inserted files will be recalculated.
                        - Chrome also include bookmarks for saved blocks of text.

                        - Restart complete AddIn sequence (if necessary).

                  Note: newly created AddIns can just be copied in AddIns directory
                  and will appear in the manager as soon as it is opened.

                - Added options to search in all opened files 
                  in search/replace commands (should be useful).

                        C: Current column[/Selected columns]
                        Current position in percents.

                  (Maybe, i'll add a customization for this later).

                - Line tooltip now displays total lines number and percent position.

                - User can now save FTP passwords in encrypted format
                  (lousy algorithm don't rely on it).

                - Improved user menus commands: %8 %9 %# and %&
                  These commands now accept two optional parameters enclosed with < and >
                  chars (first parameter is initial directory and second one is
                  dialog filters). 

                  Example:

                        %#<[ROOTDIR]\PLUGINS><QEditor Template (*.dll):*.dll>

                        Will display a file requester initially sets into
                        [ROOTDIR]\PLUGINS directory displaying all .dll files
                        of that directory. (Notice the : char instead of |).

                - Chrome now stores the list of run programs.

                - Added %N command in user menus; This command will create a new child
                  window (handy when used with QEditor's templates).

                - Del key is now functional in user menus editor.

                - Shift+arrows up/down now move up/down selected entry
                  in user menus editor.

                - RC.hlp added in [MAINHELPDIR] (due to it's "universality").

                - Added a descent favorite files manager
                  (Idea borrowed from Ultra Edit).

                - Created the PILL language to replace the "Advanced insertions"
                  (This scripting language will probably be used for wizards
                   and various code generation processes).
                  (All functions available to the AddIns are also available here).

                - Chrome should start faster.

                - Chrome now auto-correct APIs functions and constants names.

                - Added an option to open all files contained in project folders:
                  Include/Modules/Resources in context menu.

                - Added the ability to open several files at once
                  (instead of one by one) in almost every commands asking for a file.

                - Chrome now also accepts a directory as command line argument
                  (a file selector will be displayed).

                - Added the ability to use several wildcards in search in files command
                  (separated by ; chars) (+ added a list of available extensions)
                  (+ options are now saved) (+ added a list of used directories).

                - Skins can now contains explicit prologue/epilogue
                  that are inserted during building operations
                  (Edit the skin file and look for [EXTRACODE] section;
                   Put UsePrologue=0/UseEpilogue=0 if you don't need this feature
                   or your old MASM32 project doesn't like it very much).

                  Note: this is mainly used by assembly as C compilers generate
                        their own code before and after main(). The one provided
                        in masm32.mln will more or less act as a standard C crt
                        except that arguments for console exes will not be parsed
                        C like (both are parsed in WinMain style, that is command
                        line doesn't contains executable name) i'm too lazy to
                        implement the C argv/argc filler in asm but if someone
                        would like to code it then feel free to do so, also an
                        exception handler could be set here for fun and profit.

                - Added the infamous "Tip of the day".

                - Included my DirectWrap library in distrib.

                - Added a directory for Wizards.

                - Added a template file for wizards (done in PILL language).
                  To create one you'll need to modify the projectstype.ini by hand.
                  And add ..\Wizards\<Nameofthewizardfile> if the file is located in
                  Wizards dir. (There's none actually, due to my lazyness).

                - Added HexType/BinType in languages files
                  (used for bases conversions output).

                - Made some needed modifications to adapt Chrome to MASM32V8
                  (humor, humor...).

                - Added a menu for favorite files.

                - Added support for GoAsm (snippets/templates/menus).

                - Snippets menu now only displays snippets related to current
                  source language (if possible) (Idea by cakmak).

        [FIX]   - Extended DOS trapping commands output buffer to 64kb
                  (was default ~4kb previously), so that huge number of errors
                   occuring while building a project or trapping output
                   of DOS commands shouldn't freeze Chrome anymore (let's hope).

                - Chrome won't hide files bookmarks while validating main properties
                  (This bug was here since at least one year, a proof of concept).

                - Block save option will correctly remember last used directory
                  (within a session).

                - Improved recognition of procedures/functions names
                  (also nested procedures calls in Pascal/C or other languages).

                - Fixed a bug in resource properties dialog:
                  an empty resource name caused a crash.

                - Child windows resizing modified (hopefully, it should work
                  correctly on exotic machines (read: Austrians machines)).

                - Corrected child windows activation with mouse.

                - Caret position is now reported correctly while selecting
                  blocks of texts.

                - Fixed a problem with project creation dialog
                  (crashed under some old versions of common controls).

                - Fixed a little bug in "open file under cursor" option.

                - Fixed a weird bug with child windows under WinNT 4.

                - Parsing of user commands should be better.

                - Correctly dispatchs lines of texts separated with LF only
                  in output box.

                - Won't set modified flag when pasting empty texts.

                - Slightly improved popup menu in output window.

                - FTP manager will ask for password when required.

                - Default transfers type for FTP accounts is now binary.

                - Languages files can now accept several tags for single line comments
                  (separated by space char).

                - ColorFHelp/ColorGHelp/ColorHHelp keys in language files
                  weren't functionals.

                - Auto indent mode will be desactivated if no language is set
                  for the corresponding window.

                - Cpp.mln now declared as case a sensitive language
                  (i wonder why it wasn't).

                - Fixed a little bug in accelerators files saving routine.

                - Added some missing keywords in Rc.mln.

                - Speeded up Block/Registers.

                - Fixed some troubles with auto-saving.

                - Improved handling of horizontal scrollbar in output window
                  (should only appears when necessary).

                - Multi line comments weren't handled correctly in search routines.

                - Should handle read-only files correctly.

                - Project directory is now correct after first installation.

                - You may find a shortcut placed on your desktop after installation.

                - Revised Windows SDI project type.

                - Corrected handling of LCC32 errors/warnings messages.

                - Improved functions recognitions.

                - Corrected GUIDStyle in asm.mln and Cpp.mln.

                - Syntax highlighting now recognizes 0x prefix for hexadecimal numbers.

                - Modified comments precedence in syntax highlighting (higher).

                - Won't use [SOURCEDIR] when saving projects.

                - Corrected Raw results in searches (should also be slightly faster).

                - Fixed CommonDialogs project example.

                - Added lotsa keywords in asm.mln.

                - Fixed AddInConst.h.

                - Fixed a bug in AddIns manager (AddIn insertions).

                - Chrome crashed when trying to retrieve procedures list
                  of an empty file.

                - Updated weblinks.

                - Added file extensions in file saving requesters.
                  (A file saved without extension will automatically receive
                   the first one of the selected filetype).

                - MDI hwnd is now available to AddInLoad().

        [MISC]  - Added [ExtrasExt] section in main.ini (no interface yet).

                - Changed reading of custominclude/customlib keys in projectstype.ini
                  (now melted with include/lib due to lameness of lcclnk).

                - MASMEDBUILD/MASMEDBUILDEND renamed to BUILDBLOCK/BUILDBLOCKEND
                  (sorry for that).

                - Removed dumppe.

                - Splash screen isn't topmost anymore.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.34 (known as MasmEd)

        [NEW]   - Created the long time promised resource editor.
                  Handled resources are:
        
                        - Icons
                        - Cursors
                        - Bitmaps
                        - Strings
                        - Accelerators
                        - Menus
                        - Raw datas (anything else)

                   Constants for resources will be generated by MAsmEd
                   User just have to use the object name, example:
                   
                        invoke  LoadIcon,hInst,ICON_0

                   to load the first icon in list or:

                        invoke  LoadMenu,hInst,MENU_5

                   to load the sixth menu.

                        invoke  FindResource,0,RAWDATAS_0,RT_RCDATA
                        invoke  LoadResource,0,eax

                   to load first raw datas.
                   (Nb: LoadResource performs a GlobalAlloc then resources 
                   are freed by Windows itself).

                   This work for all resources except for strings of course.
                   
                   Resources labels can be renamed at will.

                   Also notice that the icon associated with project
                   (in project properties) can be accessed with constant:
                   
                        ICON_APP

                   (Project templates have been modified accordingly).

                   This resource name is FROZEN forever.
                   (Means you can't use it for your own resources).

                   For the interested ones:
                   
                   ICON_APP=500 and the rest begins at 501.
                   
                   Using auto generated constants will help you to make
                   more flexible and cleaner code.

                   Other resources are free but you shouldn't use numbers below 256
                   (according to mickeysoft specifications).

                  Produced files SHOULDN'T be modified outside MAsmEd
                  (don't come to cry if u modified them in a wrong way).
                  
                  Notice that this resources editor is not exactly finished
                  i saved some details for later.
                  
                  Notice also that empty popup menus will be filled with a faked entry
                  (won't compile otherwise).
                  
                - SNAP Will reports much more informations about used windows/objects
                  of a debugged process (the system changed a bit due to freezed
                  processes vs. messages sending synchronizations).

                - Text files referenced in a project can be either opened in MAsmEd
                  or opened with a ShellExecute().
                  (This can be useful for example with registry files or any other).
        
                - Added the ability to run or debug project without compiling it
                  (Available in treeview contextual menu, 
                  (also debugged a little thing here).

                - Added options to erase recent files/projects lists.

                - Files drag'n'drop is now accepted by mdiclient:
                  The files will simply be opened (dropping files in documents windows
                  will still insert files content at current caret position).

                - Added an option to embed a selected text into a
                  multiline comment block (depending of the file's language).

                - Added a tag char for prototypes generator (First char ONLY):

                  Example:

                        |[INCLUDEDIR]\%3.inc

                  will tell MAsmEd to not pass the complete entry to the prototype
                  generator but only use it as destination directory
                  (User will be prompted to include the real file after generation).

                  Another fine example of Mr. Steve H. sense of humor.

                  (Or maybe it was me but it worked correctly before).
                  (Anyway, project wasn't marked as modified here, fixed).

                - Added 2 shortcuts to switch project structure and output window
                  on/off (can be useful).

                - SNAP will uses some of the Windows 2000/XP new features
                  (mainly to reports much more informations about currently
                  debugged process and some other things).
                  Except much more support for this in future releases.

                - Added an option to create and insert a GUID a current caret position
                  (depending of the file's language).

                - Changed "Date/time" to "Create GUID" in contextual menu (a minor one).
                  (Amusing coz it changed again some times after).

                - Added "Builtin directives" entry in user menus:
                  MAsmEd will check the file for assembling/compilations directives
                  and will execute the specified commands.

                  The keywords are:
                                  
                        MASMEDBUILD / MASMEDBUILDEND
                        
                          Specify a group of commands.

                        other commands will be parsed/executed in the specified way.

                  Directives must be embedded in a comment block or following
                  a single line comment (depending of the file's language)
                  and can be placed anywhere in the source.

                  The available shortcuts and quick directories are the standard
                  ones (look in user menus editor for lists).

                  Here is a typical MASM32 build all:

                        ; masmedbuild RELEASE
                        ;       CAPT [BINDIR]\rc.exe /v rsrc.rc
                        ;       CAPT [BINDIR]\cvtres.exe /machine:ix86 rsrc.res
                        ;       CAPT [BINDIR]\ml.exe /c /coff %1.asm
                        ;       CAPT [BINDIR]\Link.exe /SUBSYSTEM:WINDOWS %1.obj rsrc.obj
                        ; masmedbuildend

                  Same as above but it will generate debug infos:

                        comment |
                        masmedbuild DEBUG
                                CAPT [BINDIR]\rc.exe /v rsrc.rc
                                CAPT [BINDIR]\cvtres.exe /machine:ix86 rsrc.res
                                CAPT [BINDIR]\ml.exe /Zd /Zi /c /coff %1.asm
                                CAPT [BINDIR]\Link.exe /DEBUG /DEBUGTYPE:COFF /SUBSYSTEM:WINDOWS %1.obj rsrc.obj
                        masmedbuildend
                        |

                  Another one for TASM:

                        ; masmedbuild RELEASE
                        ;       CAPT [BINDIR]\tasm32.exe /s /m /ml /z %1.asm
                        ;       CAPT [BINDIR]\tlink32.exe -x -c -Tpe %1.obj,,,import32.lib
                        ; masmedbuildend

                  Also for lcc32:

                        // masmedbuild RELEASE
                        //      CAPT [BINDIR]\lcc.exe -O %1.c -Fo%1.obj
                        //      CAPT [BINDIR]\lcclnk.exe -s -o %1.exe -subsystem windows %1.obj
                        // masmedbuildend

                  These examples can be contained in the same file.
                  Just make sure that the user command specify:

                        PREP <Directives block name>

                  Note that block names are case sensitive.

                  Note also that very few checks are performed on commands blocks,
                  the above examples will work for sure but nothing else is allowed
                  inside blocks (well actually it is allowed but will be
                  considered as a command to be executed).

                  Another note (VERY VERY IMPORTANT):
                  The commands embedded inside blocks are executed RECURSIVELY
                  with the same parsing engine, that's means that any user commands
                  can be issued. For example this:

                        ; masmedbuild RELEASE
                        ;       PREP RELEASE
                        ; masmedbuildend

                  The Result ?
                  A never ending loop (and probably a crash due to stack overflow
                  after a while). I haven't implemented any blocks tracing.

                  Well, i hope u got the picture.

                  Also commands errors will be reported in output window instead
                  of messageboxes for obvious reasons.

                  Look into Examples\LDIRC.asm or Examples\Packetsview.asm
                  for a concrete example.

                  I've also included some examples as snippets.

                - Added an option to toggle case in selected text block.

                - Added support for Microsoft DDK help.

                - Added "ResolveIP" snippet.

                - Some little additions to "Convert to db statements" function:
                  it now creates a constant with the size of the datas and a label.

                - Added an option to registers/unregister files extensions
                  associated with languages files.
                  (Also added an entry for these files in windows shell's
                  contextual menu).

                - Added an option to toggle the auto popup of output window on/off
                  (I found it annoying after a while).

                - Added an option to convert every spaces of a selected block 
                  into tabulations.

                - Modified MAsm32.skm file to handle CodeView debugging informations
                  (Can be useful for SoftIce and some other debuggers).

                - API tooltips now supports: call <APIName>,<Argumentsxxx> format.

                - Added highlighting supports for %<Register> format.

                - Added 2 snippets for MASM32 (Starter console and Starter window).

                - File/New menu now display snippets entries
                  so user can now create a document from a registered snippet
                  (this can acts as template of course).

                - Added an option to save a block of text and replace it by an include
                  statement (language dependant).

                - MAsmEd can let windows deals with files under caret:
                  ("Execute file under caret" option).

                - %7 shortcut will retrieve extension of current filename.

                - Added an option to reload the current source.

                - User can now switch MAsmEd into fullscreen mode.

                - Added a contextual menu in output window.

                - Skins now accepts TEXTB statement
                  (i modified the 3 provided skins in order to use 
                  this new feature, i also corrected tabulations here).

                - Added a handler for DEL key in FTP client
                  (will trigger delete files option).

                - Added some C++ keyword in Cpp.mln.

                - Double clicks on output window can now be done 
                  on reported Warnings (i forgot that).

                - Added a new project type for Windows NT/2000 services
                  (not tested under Windows XP but it might work).

                - MAsmEd now checks and report missing files of a loaded project
                  (These files won't be included in project tree).

                - User can now include a file as db statements.

                - Modified date/time insertions, the function now displays several 
                  dates formats to paste (formats are located in Dates.ini).

                - Added an option to use current file's directory (if any opened) when
                  opening/including/saving new file (also performed in user commands)
                  (should be more standard that way).

                - Added CUSTOMINCLUDExxx keys to ProjectsType.ini.
                  Similar to MODULExxx except that files will be referenced in Includes.
                  Allowing to reference files outside assembler/compiler
                  includes directory.

                  Similary, CUSTOMLIBxxx key will do the same for Libs.

                  Notice that projects templates will be enhanced in a near future.

                - Added some little things in Examples directory.

                - Added a project type for DirectDraw animations.
                  Also added several examples showing various basic technics
                  done during 2 intensive days.
                  (it was fun to code some graphical effects again after so many years).

                - Added some functions into WinAPI.db file for Windows 2000/XP
                  (not complete at all, will fix this later together with
                  a forthcoming database containing standard constants).

                - Better procedures recognition for C and Pascal language:
                  MAsmEd will now checks inner blocks balancing and keywords
                  on single lines according to language definition file
                  (new keywords have been added).
                  Note that there's still some problems with C language because
                  instructions blocks and procedures blocks uses same keywords.

                - Added some scope keywords in Asm.mln especially for macros 
                  definitions. Also changed:
                  (.#%)if/(.#%)else/(.#)%elseif/(.#%)endif
                  definitions to use cross references allowing else keyword to acts 
                  as both indent and outdent trigger (work also for NAsm).
                  Also modified Cpp.mln and Pascal.mln accordingly.

                - Introduced Advanced insertions system macros
                  (located in languages files); shortcuts are similar to the user 
                  menus ones and quick directories are also available.
                  + some extras chars {TAB} and {NL} 
                  and an extra command: {SEL} (select current word).
                  Commands can be separated by "|" char if necessary.

                - MAsmEd now saves splitters positions
                  (Thanks to Rainer for this suggestion).

                - Proc/Variables search and search in files options speeded up
                  (especially for big files).

                - Added an option to include current source file into project
                  modules / includes / resources / documents lists.
                  (contextual menus in project structure).

                - Added 3 new colors for languages (Colors F G H in Mln files)
                  (Idea by Neon).

                - MAsmEd will only display a simple MessageBox if there's only 
                  one file to be saved or to be reloaded.

                - Added keys for new resources handling in ProjecsType.ini:

                                ICONSxxx
                                CURSORSxxx
                                BITMAPxxx
                                STRINGSxxx
                                ACCELERATORSxxx
                                MENUSxxx
                                DIALOGSxxx
                                RAWDATASxxx

        [POST 0.34 OFFICIAL PREVIEW 1]

                - Added a Custom comment blocks option
                  {TAB} and {NL} flags are accessible here.

                - Added an option to clear arguments list
                  (can also be found in custom comments option).

                - Added a ASCII view/paste table.

                - User can now de/select the steps of project building process
                  in properties (Building Resource,Compiling/Assembling,Linking,Cleaning).
                
                  (Clean out will simply delete main .obj and .res)

                - Slightly changed some layouts here and there.

                - %8 shortcut added (simply a mix between %# and %3).

                - Current opened project is now saved into workspace files.

                - Added an option to save/restore MAsmEd state (opened files+project).
                  Notice that state will be restored only when opening MAsmEd 
                  with no arguments (displaying the splash screen).

                - MAsmEd will prompt the user for conversion when trying to open 
                  UNIX files. Also added an option in properties to remove this 
                  prompting. The converted file will just be marked as modified 
                  and not saved on disk.

                - Added an option to minimize MAsmEd into Windows Systray
                  (This function will have slightly different behaviour under Win2000++).

                - Added an option to bring MAsmEd on topmost (or not).

                - Added %C and %D shortcuts (repectively returns a selected color
                  into decimal or hexadecimal).

                - Sources templates ('New' menu) have been separated from Snippets.
                  So basically:
                  
                        - Templates files are those you can find in New menu.
                        - Snippets files are those you can find in sources context menu.

                  Also notice that a type for the file is automatically
                  added after the description (according to registered file extension).

                - Added the ability to move files inside project's treeview sections
                  with drag'n'drop (files cannot be moved across sections for obvious 
                  reasons) (Can be useful to fastly correct files inter-dependencies).

                - Added 3 empty project types for dos executables/static libraries
                  and dlls.

                - Projects entries in treeview can now be removed with DEL key
                  (not much but...).

                - Used enhanced directories browser under Windows 2000/XP.

                - Added a new skin for Free Pascal.

                  VERY IMPORTANT:
                  
                   - LIBRARIES folder in projects are considered as UNITS.
                   - Most compiler options are in properties.
                   - Program/Library/Unit names are auto generated.
                   - "Interface" keyword isn't required for units.
                   - To produce an UNIT use a STATIC LIBRARY project.
                   
                   So basically a module file should start with CONST
                   or imports/exports (or something like that).

                   (I had to enhance the Skins Engine to add this one (a real bitch)).

                - Added an option to disable regression algorithm in "search in files"
                  and "proc/var/const search" functions (Raw results).

                - Proc/Var search (renamed to Proc/Var/Const Search)
                  now also looks into plain resources files referenced in projects.

                - Added a lot of declarations in WinApi.db again (more to come).

                - File extensions for projects and workspaces files 
                  now uses 2 different icons (just for clarity purpose).

                - Modified user menus editor layout slightly 
                  and added an option to erase complete menus entries.

        [POST 0.34 OFFICIAL PREVIEW 2]

                - Added "To doc" option in found registers window
                  (creates a new source window with list content).

                - Added CopyMem snippet (was lacking).

                - Added an option to automagically zoom on already opened file without
                  asking the user (someone suggested this but i don't remember clearly
                  who, probably F0dder).

                - Added handling for entry point in exports definition
                  (Only relevant in MASM32 skin so far).
                  Notice that user shouldn't use this for DLLs, it is reserved for
                  some forthcoming expansions of projects types.

                - Introduced an Add-Ins engine. I've added a project template for this
                  No SDK yet, i'll write one if there's enough people interested 
                  by writing some. 3 stock examples are included in projects directory
                  (and in AddIns).

                  The Add-Ins manager works like this:

                        - Check the box on the left side of an add-in entry to add it
                          into the add-ins menu.

                        - Double-click on an entry to change the running state of a
                          persistant add-in, Red=stopped Green=Running.
                          (This state have no effect on correctly coded simple add-ins).

                  Persistant add-ins are loaded/unloaded when user wants them running/stopped
                  and at MAsmEd start/stop (the running state of a persistant add-in is saved).

                - Created AddIns:
                
                        - AddInASCII (View/Paste ascii chars)
                        - AddInGUID (Create/Paste a GUID)
                        - AddInDATEIME (Paste current date)

                - Added the ability to change projects directory.

                - Projects and output box toolbars are now embedded in pagers
                  so it should be easier to add new icons here.

                - Added recents files and recents projects lists into systray menu.

                - Added a project type to create control panel extensions.

                - Changed projectstype.ini slightly: added an optional field in
                  main definition, if present MAsmEd will perform a post
                  rename operation on the produced file with the given extension
                  (See definition of control panel type).

                - Added Release in versioning system (as it should be).

                - User can now specify if MAsmEd should include version resource
                  in produced file or not.
                  Note: this function supersedes skin's AddVInfo tag if unchecked.
                  
                - Added the ability to include a Windows XP manifest resource
                  in produced files (not tested extensively but should work).

                - Improved project creation dialog (it can now be displayed at start
                  and it includes recents opened projects).

                - Added a project type for Windows NT++ drivers creation
                  (not tested at all).

                - Added handling and language def. for HTML files.

                - Added an user menu entry to display current HTML file
                  in default web browser.

                - Added HighlightNbrs tag in languages definitions files.

                - %9 shortcut added (like %8 but returns %4 instead of %3).

                - Created a true about window (blah).

                - Added a little contextual menu in user menus editor.

                - Added an option to auto correct APs names cases on the fly.

                - API database handling revised, should be MUCH faster
                  (especially for APIs names cases corrections).

                - Added handling for ENTER key in projects treeview: 
                  it will performs default option for the selected entry.

                - Added current file percent position in status bar.

                - Added some colors profiles.

                - Added optional linkers arguments ability in skins.

                - Added a pascal test example (borrowed from Free Pascal distribution).

                - Added an entry in Tools user menu to run Windows calculator
                  (Useful to have it ready sometimes).

        [FIX]   - Corrected some problems with filenames passed to resource builders
                  (Spaces and slashes commands).

                - SNAP will not display debugged process working sizes if not supported
                  by Operating System.

                - Forgot to send project arguments when debugging with SNAP.
                  Also arguments won't be passed with quotes anymore.

                - Modified some factory settings due to
                  Mr Steve Hutchesson's sense of humor
                  (and my lameness of course).

                - Fixed a bug in user commands: directory without filename (%5)
                  crashed when no files opened (a.s.o.).

                - Shift+S keystroke in source windows wasn't accessible due
                  to registered accelerator (a.s.o. again)
                  (Was fixed in v0.33 Rev B).

                - Another stupid one on open file under caret option: 
                  trying to open a file from column 1 made it crash.
                  Also this command will open a file selector if it determines
                  that the selection is only a directory.
                  (Fixed in v0.33 Rev C).

                - Files dialogs in user commands will now remembers last used
                  directories. (Was fixed in v0.33 Rev C).

                - Fixed some little things with SysCommands
                  (especially windows list weren't reachable).

                - Non-recoverable exceptions puts SNAP into DeadEnd mode.

                - Added Realxx types in Asm.mln.

                - Trying to run an user command on a newly created file while autosave
                  was turned on confused the commands parser a bit
                  (trying to perform command on the old name).

                - Fixed a bug in required arguments (%? trigger).

                - Finally, MAsmEd can handle user commands with spaces 
                  (A very old one, just found out the time to fix it).

                - Saving a file under a new/different extension (registered or not)
                  will modify the layout accordingly (the syntax highlighting mainly).

                - Expand procedure function should work correctly now.

                - Escape key should now work correctly in dialog windows
                  (also it can be used to remove API tooltips).

                - MAsmEd crashed when trying to open weird files from
                  Run command (like inexistant files).

                - Updated Asm.mln: some @xxx commands and NAsm constants
                  were misplaced.

                - Project icon wasn't displayed in project properties 
                  right after creation.

                - Better syntax highlighting for NAsm (especially for the preprocessor).

                - Conversion to db statements should be faster.

                - Syntax highlighting improved (especially for hexadecimal numbers)
                  I finally found some times to improve that CodeMax slightly,
                  there's still some bugs left (like the page up/down column problem)
                  i'll check that next time.

                - Changed the status bar handling
                  (status flags should not disappears anymore).

                  Meaning of the flags:

                        O = Overtype
                        X = Syntax highlighting
                        W = White spaces
                        T = Auto expand Tabs to spaces
                        B = Cursor wrap (bounded to selection)
                        S = Smooth scrolling
                        L = Line tooltips
                        N = Auto normalize case

                        (On=Sunken Off=Raised)

                - Updated Asm.mln again: added some MASM high level syntax keywords
                  + some instructions for C inlines.

                - Fixed a bug in search in files function: 
                  compressed directories weren't checked correctly.

                - %% shortcut (Save file dialog in user menus) changed to %&
                  (%% now means single % char).

                - Rc.mln improved slightly.

                - MAsmEd now recognizes if an opened file had been deleted externally
                  (how smart !) and will mark it has modified.

                - Shame on me (again): i forgot to clear modified flag for saved files.

                - Corrected a little thing with the files selection window:
                  The list will auto-adapt to largest filename.

                - Corrected a "misconception" when checking for externally 
                  modified files (Never thrust VB to internally report 
                  correct filetime under WinNT/2000).

                - Fixed a bug in project building (errors weren't correctly reported).

                - Boyer moore's algorithm for strings length calculations
                  dropped completly (some procedures will be slightly slower
                  but will not produce page faults).

                - MAsmEd's context help sometimes crashed when no sources opened.

                - Fixed registers report files (lines numbers weren't saved correctly).

                - Fixed a bug in FTP client: forgot to re-display directory after 
                  uploading files (also client mode wasn't resetted).

                - Corrected a bug in dlls procedures exports:
                  MAsmEd always used assembly language prototypes (even for C).

                - Proc search and search in files functions now adapts better
                  to scanned files (there's still some problems with blocks 
                  of comments for non-asm files).

                - Added some keywords in Rc.mln concerning MENUITEM resource
                  and some other things.

                - Corrected some bugs in files dropping into source windows
                  (MAsmEd will append dropped files correctly and will use
                  language of the first one if source window is untitled).

                - MAsmEd should now react more correctly to system colors changes.

                - Slightly improved projects treeview.

                - Projects opened via shell are now added into recent projects list.

                - Fixed a bug in api tooltips
                  (crashed when trying to find (impossible) api names with 
                  "weird" second char (eg. digit) due an early exit generating
                  a stack corruption).

                - Adding an entry into treeview project now correctly refreshes
                  parent item (same goes for others treeviews).

                - Fixed Dasm.bat file to use local dumppe.exe instead of MASM32's one.

                - Corrected a bug with %6 trigger: Froze if caret was in first column
                  and under a dot char (Thanks to f0dder for this tricky one).

                - Proc/Variables search crashed when performing on non-saved files
                  and other little things. (Thanks to f0dder for that one too).
                  
                - Proc/Variables and search in file functions now passes over
                  undertermined files types (also missed some included files).

                - Fixed toolbars little layout problem
                  (i was well aware of that but f0dder reminded this to me).

                - Should be able to handle spaces in user batch files and in
                  projects names.

                - Changed some layout in sources lines tooltips (not very important).

                - Handling of Enter key added where it can be handled (in most dialogs).

                - Corrected bookmarks's shortcuts in contextual menus
                  (were from an older version).

                - Fixed a problem with width of fonts under Windows 2000
                  (maybe XP too), so Lucida console font should looks better.
                  Also the highlighted lines should be displayed correctly (i hope).

                - .asi and .mac files correctly handled.

                - Better handling of projects templates files
                  (won't crash if referenced file doesn't exists).

                - Replaced nasm.exe entries in user menus with nasmw.exe.

        [POST 0.34 OFFICIAL PREVIEW 1]

                - Use of ES_NUMBER in Goto Line dialog (looks less messy that way).

                - AutoSave notifications should appears when expected
                  (not while debugging hehe).

                - Main window went to background sometimes. Fixed.

                - Skins structure have been revised SERIOUSLY.

                - API tooltips slightly improved regarding C/Pascal functions.

                - Properties dialog can be validated with ENTER key (ESC cancels it).

                - Fixed lotsa bugs in skins files (especially TAsm32.skm).

                - Project building now reports warnings (forgot that).

                - Improved Lcc32 compilation skin (also debugged).

                - Corrected some little things in Rc.mln and Pascal.mln.

                - Improved procedures collapsing/expanding.
                  (I suggest you to NOT to try this one with C/C++ files,
                  so far the procedure recognition for these files
                  is not working at 100%).

                - Improved DLLs procedures exports
                  (goes with procedure/function recognition).

                - Fixed a little bug in auto generated VERSIONINFO resource
                  (some resources compiler REQUIRES four digits for versions numbers).

                - Slightly improved Rc.mln.

                - Better recognition of includes for C/C++, Pascal and Resources.

                - Added some recognitions keywords in cgrep.ini
                  (mainly for C/C++, Pascal and Resources).

                - Fixed a bug while saving toolbars in TB manager.

                - Fixed a little bug in properties: MAsmEd won't complain about
                  unsaved FTP accounts forever and ever.

        [POST 0.34 OFFICIAL PREVIEW 2]

                - Ctrl+C won't copy empty selections into clipboard anymore
                  (was a little bit annoying after a while).

                - Double clicks on lists checkboxes won't check/uncheck wrong items.

                - Fixed some dates formats in dates.ini file.

                - Corrected a Windows 95 bug in DirectDraw examples/Template
                  (Thanks to hutch for having noticed that).

                - Treeview drag'n'drop should now works correctly in resources folder.
                
                - Click'o'mania won't disturb MAsmEd anymore on API tooltips
                  and Windows 2000++ menus extensions of scrollbars.
                  (Thanks to VKim or VSkim or Skim).

                - Added SWORD in Asm.mln (hehe).

                - Now zoom correctly on already opened files
                  (Tried to focus on null hwnd).

                - API tooltips correctly replaced after active view changing.

                - Corrected some little things on search routines.

                - Added several keywords in Asm.mln.

                - Cleaned up some skins again.

                - Fixed a bug in exports files for available plugins templates
                  (functions weren't exported at all).

                - Main popup menu will be displayed at caret position if keyboard's
                  popup key is used (thanks to volki tolki for that one).

                - Corrected a bug in projects properties: frame disapeared when
                  pressing escape key in version informations datas
                  (thanks to volki tolki for that one too).

                - Non-modal dialogs should adapt more correctly to various
                  Windows appearances.

                - Added ifnb and elseif in Asm.mln (forgot that).

                - Fixed a problem with memory handling concerning APIs database
                  functions.

                - Added XMMs registers in languages files.

                - Fixed a bug with non-existant files registered as snippets or
                  templates (stoopid one).

                - Fixed a bug in registers searching function
                  (wasn't language sensitive).

                - MAsmEd won't run on outdated systems anymore
                  (my eyes nearly felt out of my head when i saw how awful it was).
                  I can think of some workaround if someone ask it expressively
                  (But i hope not).

                - Improved Pascal.mln slightly.

                - Fixed a bug when trying to save a read only file
                  (was marked as saved).

                - Fixed a bug in FTP client: answering 'no' to connection breaking
                  didn't worked very well...

        [NOTE]  - Due to the new debugging system introduced in previous version
                  Snap.asm is not automagically included in project before building:
                  you'll have to do it yourself (forgot to point that last time).
                  The file is still located in [TEMPLATEDIR]\Snap.asm.

                - Never mentioned it but comment blocks in asm can be customized
                  in file [LANGUAGESDIR]\Asm.mln in MultiLineComment1/2 entries.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.33

        [!!!]   - User MUST REPLACE the -> PAUSE <- commands included in each MAsm32
                  batch files with -> EXIT <- or MAsmEd DOS CAPT feature won't work
                  properly. 

                  Also some of these batch redirects output to custom files:

                        Example:

                        \masm32\bin\ml /c /coff %1.asm > \masm32\bin\asmbl.txt

                  MAsmEd won't trap such tricks.

                  Every other batch files must follow the same rules.

                - ICE removed: it will be back soon, stronger and more usable.

                - Install process changed a bit.
                  MAsmEd doesn't register files anymore in registry base
                  it doesn't overwrite these ini files:

                        usermenus.ini
                        colors.ini
                        toolbars.ini
                        ftpaccounts.ini
                        skins.ini
                        and maybe some others...

                  and only put icons in programs folder.

        [NEW]   - INTERNAL STRUCTURE CHANGED RADICALLY:

                        - Source rewritten in a more modular way.
                        - All COM servers removed (ocxs/dlls).
                          (except for the vb virtual machine
                          but it will disappear in a next version).

                  So everything is done "by hand" (APIs) resulting nicer interface,
                  greater overall speed, distribution filesize reduction,
                  lighter memory usage (much lighter)
                  and a permanent headache for me, thank you.

                Apart from that here are the news:

                - MAsmEd now send it's statusbar handle to the QEPlugins
                  the toolbar handle remains 0 (so a QEPlugin can recognizes from where
                  it is called from and acts accordingly).

                - Added options to remove obsoletes files from recent files/projects lists.

                - Added 3DNow(tm)(r)(c)(agaga) instructions in languages.ini file.

                - Added an option to jump to procedure prototypes.

                - Languages.ini file corrected/updated for MAsm32 v7
                  (also added some missing keywords for x86).

                - User can now reorganize (drag and drop) columns in search results
                  (file will be saved accordingly).

                - Improved editing capabilities.

                - Improved user menus editor slightly.

                - Documents windows can be auto maximized when opened.

                - Added a menu entry for sending bugs reports, it will create
                  an auto mail, just fill it with your comments.

                - Added a FTP manager (client).
                  Please notice that this manager was done for coders teams
                  who wants to share files on mini-hosts/personal workstations
                  ftp servers which contents changes a lot
                  (i don't know if it can be used by TACs).
                  So no cache is used for directories, resulting lack of performances
                  in directories refreshing for example (but it's still fast enough).
                  Also it was not tested on unix servers.
                  Dirty users who wants to download big files still needs a true 
                  ftp client.
                  Also notice that you will need to use binary transfers types
                  if you're about to retrieve binary files (executables for example)
                  coz there's no file type checking.

                - Changed some menus layout and added some shortcuts here and there.

                - Lucky (and proud) owners of a three buttons mouse will be able
                  to click on the left margin with the middle button to select a
                  procedure (left margin must be turned on, of course).
                  Also notice that a click on a word with this button will select it
                  and a double click will select the complete line.
                  (Provided that the system is correctly configured to recognize
                  third mousebutton of course).

                - Added a toolbars manager.
                  Maybe it is not clear: user can drag and drop commands he/she
                  wants to put in or remove from the lists
                  (double clicks also works but adds the entry at the end of the list).

                - MAsmEd should be fully Windows 2000 compatible now.
                  In fact it was re-developped on it with my brand new old Cyrix 133,
                  so now what you say ? (Idiotic Bullshit Machine ?)

                - User can select Document file in user menus editor.
                  The command will be considered as a text, workspace or project
                  and will be opened directly into MAsmEd,
                  so it can be used as "favorites" or something like that.

                - Changed the way AutoSaving works.
                  MAsmEd can now display or not all opened and non saved files
                  at the periodic interval selected by the user.

                - Added a find fast option.
                  (search for word under caret or current selection).

                - Added a MakeLib batch file in MAsmEd main directory
                  (and an according entry in MASM32 menu).

                - Added an option to clear output window before running
                  user commands that uses DOS capture.

                - Added some help messages in user menus editor.

                - Added a MakeDll batch file in MAsmEd main directory
                  (and an according entry in MASM32 menu too).

                - Templates definitions changed a little:
                  Added some extras infos and .def files handling for dlls.
                  (older projects are still compatible).

                - Added a project type for QEditor plugins.

                - Added a project type for mIRC plugins (why not after all).

                - Introduced project building skins files.
                  so user can now uses project manager with other things that MAsm32.

                - Prototypes generator for static libraries is now customizable.
                  Where to find it out ?
                  Context menu in project treeview (libraries entries).
                  Shortcuts are same as for user menus.

                - Added Dec2Hex/Dec2Bin/Hex2Dec/Hex2Bin/Bin2Dec/Bin2Hex
                  numeric conversions in documents contextual menu.

                - Contextual grep results skew exported in cgrep.ini.

                - Languages engine is now much more flexible:
                  All definitions have been exported into languages directory
                  (No editor yet).

                - MAsmEd will now checks plugins entries in user menus to determine
                  the type of it (implemented here for futurs extensions).

                - Added an option to select default language for new created files.
                
                - Added an option to remove that annoying tooltips in projects treeview.

                - Added an option to use windows recent files list.

                - API tooltips now recognizes ( char.

                - SNAP v0.2 completly rewritten too
                  (not yet a full debugger but still "astucious" enough and working
                  correctly under Windows 2000 this time).

                - Added TIMER command to SNAP: It should be used by pair, the first
                  one will will store current uptime and the second will calculate
                  (and display) the difference in milliseconds between the two uses.
                  (Can be useful to measure routines speeds).
                  Also SNAP will now reports much more informations about created
                  processes/threads and DLLs loading.

                - SNAP now handles exceptions and reports FPU state.
                  No MMX instructions yet coz my CPU doesn't handle them
                  so i can't make tests (all simply).

                - SNAP also maintains a windows list
                  (Can be updated with "Retrieve process informations" option).

                - Added a color profile in properties and modified another one.

                - User will now be able to specify debug program for project building.

                - Search functions will now try to search includes in the directory
                  of the currently checked file.

        [FIX]   - MAsmEd crashed when trying to create or open a file
                  from a project without appropriate directory structure
                  (masm32 distribution not installed for example hehe).

                - Newly created projects are now added in recent projects list.

                - Comment/Uncomment blocks should be faster now (couldn't be worser)
                  Also debugged a little bit.

                - Insert date/time improved slightly.

                - Corrected some little problems with expand procedure function.

                - Snippets registration fastened.

                - Relative path correctly handled when referring to source directory.

                - Improved caret behaviours (especially when focusing).

                - User menus editor crashed when no menus present.

                - Registers search fastened and corrected.

                - Variables / procedures searches completly rewritten
                  (should be slightly faster and "clever and smart").

                - Words selections in editor should be better.

                - DOS output listbox improved slightly (removed some weird chars).

                - Drag listbox in user menus editor changed slightly too.

                - MAsmEd now stays in tasklist while displaying a dialog window
                  (f0dder noticed that a long time ago).

                - DOS output capture completly rewritten.

                - API tooltips font now handled correctly under Windows 2000 (hehehe).

                - Search functions won't process obsoletes files specified
                  in include statements anymore
                  (caused mangled results due to function brutal exiting).

                - "Update" shortcut now points to MAsmEd page (important or what ?).

                - Listview sorting is now handled correctly (especially with numbers).

                - Corrected a bug in recent lists (empty list sometimes).

                - Corrected numerous GPF under windows 2000
                  (well it was internal to 0.33 version but who knows).

                - Changed the menu entry: Run Makeit.bat, it now uses [SOURCEDIR].

                - Corrected a little bug in project properties:
                  MAsmEd crashed when user selected same icon file.

                - Project properties layout changed a bit: modifications are
                  only effective after user press ok.

                - MAsmEd now checks if a file exists before opening it when
                  using recent lists.

                - Adding include file with .asm/.s extensions didn't included
                  corresponding library file (after user's choice).

                - MAsmEd now checks if filename is already referenced
                  in a project before adding it.

                - Project building fastened.

                - Some texts renamed according to new functions.

                - Couldn't select procedures at end of files. Fixed.

                - Output window behaviours changed slightly
                  (user must now double click to jump to error).

                - Search options crashed sometimes, fixed.

                - Removed file extensions for lousy languages.

                - Removed useless projects examples.

                - C/Pascal (also Asm) highlighting improved.
                  (Pascal file also recognizes Delphi up to version 2).

                - Fixed some problems with little dos (dirty) irc example
                  (Still mostly harmless coz mostly bugged).

                - Fixed the way arguments dialog works: command will be issued
                  only when user press Ok button (wasn't intuitive enough ?).

                - SNAP processes switched in pause mode right after being created
                  (more useful that way or what ?).

                - Fixed some extras problems with SNAP (like zombies processes).

                - Removed big.api file: only winapi.db is now distributed
                  (makedb.exe vanished too).

                - User commands weren't translated when no documents windows opened
                  it will now acts the same way with our without opened documents.

                - ANY unknown commands to SNAP will be displayed
                  and a FREEZE command will be issued.

                - Empty user commands are not processed anymore.

        [NOTE]  - User menus are now located in file: UserMenus.ini.
                  This will prevent overwriting during future installations
                  (if there's any).

                - Languages.ini structure changed: it is now an entry point file
                  pointing to the "Languages" directory.
                  File extensions related to languages are also stored in this file.
                  Context help files are referenced in each *.mln file.

                - [MASMDIR] renamed to [ROOTDIR] so beware.

                - Toolbars buttons using user commands will be refreshed if user menus
                  are modified, MAsmEd will try to correct associated buttons or 
                  delete them if referenced commands can't be found so don't be 
                  surprised if things disapears. Also notice that modifying parameters
                  while running several instances of MAsmEd will certaintly produces
                  strange results.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.32

        [NEW]   - Added an option to generate prototypes from .lib files
                  in project manager (right click in a lib) it uses hutch's
                  L2inca.exe.

                - User can now specify .chm/.col help files in user menus
                  (I forgot that last time).

                - User menus editor improved a bit, user can now specify
                  command type with a combobox.

                - MAsmEd can now trap DOS boxes output:

                        (Command prefixed with "CAPT " keyword).

                        All StdOut/StdErr writes will be redirected to
                        MAsmEd's status window.

                        Note:
                         If You're using hutch's distrib batch files you'd
                         better remove the "pause" keyword at the end of the
                         files or it will stay with an empty dos box until you
                         press the "any" key.

                - Added an option to clear status window.

                - Added a button to save project on project (little) toolbar.

                - New available path:

                        [SOURCEDIR]             Current source directory.

                - Added an option to Select a procedure and collapse it
                  (mapped to Ctrl+Q):

                        Example user hit Ctrl+Q on this procedure:

                                RaiseError      proc    ErrorMessage:dword
                                                invoke  StdOut,addr MsgErr
                                                invoke  StdOut,ErrorMessage
                                                invoke  StdOut,addr CRLF
                                                invoke  StdOut,addr MsgTerminated
                                                invoke  ExitProcess,0
                                RaiseError      endp

                        It will be converted to:

                                                include RaiseError.asm ; --- Collapsed procedure: RaiseError

                        And a new file called "RaiseError.asm" will be created
                        in the same source directory (any similar file will be
                        erased so be careful).

                        Note:
                         Do NOT modify the generated line in any way !
                         (You can still remove the lousy comment if you want).

                        Procedure are expanded with Ctrl+W by placing
                        caret on concerned line.

                - User can now use %6 in user commands to retrieve current word
                  of current source (will be blank if no source opened)
                  so user can now add his own context help files (.hlp/.chm/.col)
                  by adding %6 as argument for help files.

                - User can now specify if command opens a html file
                  (MAsmEd will not ask for file saving).

                - All factory settings have been changed according to new
                  users commands (also acts as examples).

                -  DumpPE now included with MAsmEd and added a new option to
                   use it on a project: Dump project
                   (Work better with debug informations on turned on).

                - API tooltips now uses windows current tooltips font/size.
                  (F0dder was here again with this fine idea).

        [FIX]   - Proc/Variables search speeded up.

                - Search in files now performs include checking (again).

                - Removed a bug in menus handling: MAsmEd won't remove windows
                  menus anymore (sorry, i didn't noticed that).

                - MSDN popup menu was not reachable.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.31

        [NOTE]  - This version never happened what you're reading is just a time slip.

        [NEW]   - MAsmEd now supports .chm and .col help files.
                  (Thanks to F0dder for the idea).

                - MAsmEd can be linked to MSDN (key mapped to Ctrl+F1)
                  it also works as context help.

        [FIX]   - Search in files option fastened and improved
                  (should be usable now).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.30

        [NEW]   - Added an option to switch accept files on/off.
                  (Like said before files accept option can be used
                  to construct sources as it includes the content of a file
                  at cursor position).

                - Added an option to enable a vertical splitter in source windows.

        [FIX]   - Changed the ghost install 1.6.4 to 1.6.5 this will hopefully
                  correct some problems with windows XP.

                  If not then extract the whole archive with winrar
                  (i guess you already did that didn't you ?) and use
                  regsvr32.exe to register the file cmax20.ocx.

                  This can solve the problem (not sure).

                - Corrected some problems with hutch's QEPlugins
                  now MAsmEd will emulate some RTB messages:

                        EM_EXGETSEL
                        EM_GETSELTEXT
                        EM_REPLACESEL

                        EM_EXSETSEL is ignored

                  (AblockC and CBlockC are working).

                  ** Tell me if you need more **

                - Corrected LDIRC.asm example.

                - Some words in languages.ini were wrong? fixed my colonel!

                - I didn't mentioned it but programs running without project
                  manager and using SNAP should include this:

                        include \masmed\templates\snap.asm

                  in order to access to the commands.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.29

        [NEW]   - Created a module for SNAP functions (snap.asm).

                - User can choose to turn SNAP Off/On or On + Include
                  The later option will include the SNAP functions to a project
                  at the end of includes list (it will requires kernel32.inc).

                - SNAP function "SAVFILE" modified: Snap_FileName now must contains
                  a pointer to the filename (which MUST be null terminated).

                        Snap_SavFile            db      "SAVFILE:"
                                                db      0               ; Must be null
                        Snap_FileName           dd      0               ; Changed here
                        Snap_AdrToSave          dd      0
                        Snap_LenToSave          dd      0
                                                db      0

                        Check the file Snap.asm in Templates dir for more infos.

                - SNAP commands ShowHex8/ShowHex16/ShowHex32 also display number
                  in decimal.

                - User can now add .asm files in includes section of a project
                  (this will allow more flexibility in project creation).

                - Added a function to register user infos in project properties
                  (fields will be automatically filled at each new project creation).
                  It register (in MasmEd.ini):

                                - Company name
                                - Legal copyright
                                - Legal trademarks

                - MAsmEd now search in API reference when assembling reports
                  undefined symbols and display the corresponding lib (if found).

                - Added an option to use smooth (synchronized) scrolling in source windows.

                - Added an option to make caret always visible (follow scrolling).

                - Changed layout of Editor properties.

                - Added colors profiles.

                - Added SNAP "official" functions in languages.ini.

                - Added an option to enable/disable text drag and drop in source windows.

                - Added an option to use italic comments (saved in profiles too).

                - Added an option to auto expand tabs to spaces.

                - Added an option to automatically create .BAK files.

                - User can choose where .BAK files will be created
                  (If no directory specified MAsmEd will save the file at
                  current location).

                - User can specify if new files will be auto saved or not.

                - Implemented an auto correction option
                  (it will normalize the case from words registered in languages.ini).

                - Added support for hutch's MASMLIB in context help.

                - Changed the "factory settings" of the user menus.

                - User can add PLUG prefix in user menus editor in order
                  to TRY to run a hutch's QEditor plugin (some are not working at all).

        [FIX]   - Changing background color in properties won't produce
                  garbage in source files (thanks to dxantos for that one).

                - Changed icons of sizer bars to standard ones (very important !).

                - MAsmEd will correctly empty project informations.

                - Couldn't remove any project file if no forms opened, fixed.

                - API tooltip will be replaced when window is resized.

                - Corrected some little things with source preview in properties.

                - Languages.ini extended to MASM32 SP2.

                - User commands weren't correctly launched when an untitled
                  document was opened without being modified.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.28

        [NEW]   - Added 2 snippets.

                - Added some options to project building:

                        - Maximum processor type.
                        - Allow privileged instructions or not.
                        - Allow MMX instructions or not.
                        - Default data aligments.

                - Added a little test project for OpenGL.

        [FIX]   - Shame on me !

                        Clicking Yes on saving files form didn't saved anything.

                - Also a bug in the history file (look below):
                        You should read:

                                OutputDebugString

                        Instead of:

                                OutDebugString

                - Fixed MAsm separators in languages.ini
                  + added some missing words.

                - Removed a bug in Resource error jumps
                  (MAsmEd opened a new instance of the resource file
                  bcoz of an extra space at end of the filename)
                  (how life can be sometimes).

                - Corrected a little bug with api tooltips.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.27

        [NEW]   - Added some more menus for existing commands.

                - Added WinAPI syntax completion for INVOKE instruction
                  (with a rather big database).

                - Added a (very) primitive debugger (called SNAP) to project
                  manager. It can be controlled in user's program with
                  OutputDebugString() API function. SNAP have 8 commands:

                        (Every commands should ends with a null byte)

                        Snap_CmdState   db      "STATE"
                                        db      0
                                        invoke  OutputDebugString,ADDR Snap_CmdState

                        this will display the current processor state for the thread.

                        Snap_CmdFreeze  db      "FREEZE"
                                        db      0
                                        invoke  OutputDebugString,ADDR Snap_CmdFreeze

                        this will freeze the current thread (pause mode).

                        Snap_CmdDead    db      "DEAD"
                                        db      0
                                        invoke  OutputDebugString,ADDR Snap_CmdDead

                        this will stop the current thread.

                        Snap_CmdShowMem db      "SHOWMEM:"
                        Snap_AdrToView  dd      0
                                        db      0

                                        mov     Snap_AdrToView,eax
                                        invoke  OutputDebugString,ADDR Snap_CmdShowMem

                        this will display AdressToView in Memory view part of Snap
                        (provided that there's a valid address in eax).

                        Snap_CmdToHex08 db      "TOHEX08:"
                        Snap_BToShow    db      0
                                        db      0

                                        mov     Snap_BToShow,al
                                        invoke  OutputDebugString,ADDR Snap_CmdToHex08

                        this will display the byte in output area.

                        Snap_CmdToHex16 db      "TOHEX16:"
                        Snap_WToShow    dw      0
                                        db      0

                                        mov     Snap_WToShow,ax
                                        invoke  OutputDebugString,ADDR Snap_CmdToHex16

                        this will display the word in output area.

                        Snap_CmdToHex32 db      "TOHEX32:"
                        Snap_DToShow    dd      0
                                        db      0

                                        mov     Snap_DToShow,eax
                                        invoke  OutputDebugString,ADDR Snap_CmdToHex32

                        this will display the longword in output area.

                        Snap_SavFile    db      "SAVFILE:"
                        Snap_FileName   db      "c:\myfile",0
                        Snap_AdrToSave  dd      0
                        Snap_LenToSave  dd      0
                                        db      0

                                        invoke  OutputDebugString,ADDR Snap_SavFile

                        this will fill a new file with the contents of the given address.

                   All other strings will simply popup in the output area
                   (this can be used for variables watches for example).

                   Note 1: Disassembly is not supported yet (maybe later)
                           also there's no exceptions handling.

                   Note 2: To change registers or memory address,
                           SNAP must be in pause mode.
                           (Use right mousebutton on a register or memory area).

                   Note 3: You can also run an user command with SNAP by using
                           "SNAP" prefix before the command (this only work with
                           win32 executables) example:

                           SNAP "%1.exe" "%@"

                           this will open the .exe file of the current source
                           with SNAP (and asks for optional arguments).

                - MAsmEd now display corresponding import lib for
                  unresolved symbols in project linking (if found in database).

                - Added an option to specify case sensitive assembly in
                  Properties/Assembler.

                - MAsmEd now reports some informations about project creation
                  in status window.

        [FIX]   - (These 2 ones were fixed in the lastest release of 0.26)
                  - MAsmEd now recognizes and uses relative paths for registered snippets.
                  - Passing over ICE Server menu won't crash MAsmEd.

                - Splash screen wasn't removed in single instance mode
                  (another stupid one).

                - "Run project" now passes project's current directory.

                - Select procedure command now recognizes single endp
                  found in a line (for TASM).

                - Changed the way of handling calls types.
                  Change it only if you know what you're doing.

                - Added some keywords to languages.ini

        [NOTE]  - I just found out that user can swap between opened files
                  with Ctrl+TAB (hehe).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.26

        [NEW]   - Script engine removed and replaced by the first public
                  version of I.C.E. (look in ice.txt for more infos)

                  snippets into the sources.

                - Added a %# argument to user commands. MAsmEd will prompt the user
                  with a file selector before running the command (look somewhere
                  in this file for a complete set of commands).

                - Added %% argument (same as above except that it gives the user
                  a SaveFileName dialogbox).

                - Added %* argument (same as above except that it gives the user
                  a Shell BrowseDirectory dialogbox).

                - Added a little script engine for fast code pasting
                  (Some examples ar included).

                   Write Text                       : Write a line of text in the current source
                   DeleteFile FileName              : Delete a file (or several)
                   OpenFile FileName                : Open a file
                   SaveFile FileName                : Save a file
                   CopyFile FileName,FileName       : Copy a file

                  Some functions are also availables:

                  _straccumulator_ for later uses.

                  You can also use %1 %2 %3 %4 %? %@ %# %% %* to retrieve
                  filenames/directories as in user commands.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.22

        [NEW]   - Error report for project assembling changed to a listbox
                  so you can now click on an error to jump directly to it
                  (for resources and assembly errors only).

                - U can catch events from dos batch files by using -s
                  switch in command line
                        For example:

                           \masm32\bin\ml /c /coff %1.asm >Output

                        Use:

                           c:\MAsmEd\MAsmEd.exe -s Output

                  The opened file will by redirected to listbox and will work
                  the same way as mentioned before.

        [FIX]   - The VB runtimes are not in the install pack anymore
                  (You can download this on the site if you need them).

        [NOTE]  - I never mentioned it but MAsmEd can recognize C and Pascal syntax
                  as well so it can be used for several purposes.

                  references if nothing else is found.

                  assembling.

        [NOTE]  - A temporary way to redirect the output of dos commands to MAsmEd:
                  In properties:
                        Uncheck "Allow multiple instance" option.
                        In ur batch file put a >Output at the end of any command.
                        For example:
                           \masm32\bin\ml /c /coff %1.asm >Output
                        And add:
