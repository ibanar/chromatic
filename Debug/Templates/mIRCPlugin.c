mWnd
  handle to the main mIRC window.

aWnd
  handle of the window in which the command is being issued,
  this might not be the currently active window if the command is being called

data 
  the information that you wish to send to the DLL.
  On return, the DLL can fill this variable with the command it wants mIRC
  to perform if any.

parms
  is filled by the DLL on return with parameters that it wants mIRC to use
  when performing the command that it returns in the data variable.

show
  FALSE if the . prefix was specified to make the command quiet, or TRUE otherwise.

nopause
  TRUE if mIRC is in a critical routine and the DLL must not do anything that pauses
  processing in mIRC, eg. the DLL should not pop up a dialog.

The mIRCPlugIn() routine can return: 

0 means that mIRC should /halt processing.
1 means that mIRC should continue processing.
2 means that it has filled the data variable with a command
  which it wants mIRC to perform, and has filled parms with
  the parameters to use, if any, when performing the command.
3 means that the DLL has filled the data variable with the result
  that $dll() as an identifier should return. */
